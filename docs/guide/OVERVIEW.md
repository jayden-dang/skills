# Navigation

Three ways in: by role, by problem, or by phase.

## By role

### I'm adopting this on my team's repo

1. [When to use it](methodology/when-to-use.md) — and when not to
2. [Overview](methodology/overview.md) — what the system is, in one page
3. [Ceremony tiers](methodology/ceremony-tiers.md) — how it scales down for small work
4. [Adopting the skill set](resources/adopting.md) — install, `/setup-repo`, and the incremental path
5. [Tier 2: a feature, end to end](examples/tier-2-feature.md) — see it run

### I'm a teammate being handed this

1. [Overview](methodology/overview.md)
2. [Ceremony tiers](methodology/ceremony-tiers.md) — this answers "do I really have to write a spec for *this*?"
3. [The process](process/README.md) — the chain, and which flow your work belongs in
4. [Examples](examples/tier-0-tweak.md) — start with tier 0; it is the shortest
5. When lost: run `/ask`, or read [`ask`](skills/ask.md)

### I maintain this skill set

1. [Philosophy](methodology/philosophy.md) — the six principles and what enforces each
2. [The skill model](concepts/skill-model.md) — invocation kinds, the description rule, the authoring vocabulary
3. [`writing-skills`](skills/writing-skills.md) — the Iron Law, and the deployment checklist
4. [Enforcement and tooling](resources/scripts.md) — the `trace` skill and the session hook
5. [`DESIGN.md`](../../DESIGN.md) — the architecture spec of record

### I'm evaluating this from the outside

1. [Overview](methodology/overview.md) — the problem, and the shape of the answer
2. [Traceability](concepts/traceability.md) — the idea everything else hangs off
3. [Tier 2: a feature, end to end](examples/tier-2-feature.md) — the whole system in one story
4. [When to use it](methodology/when-to-use.md) — the honest boundaries

| I want to… | Go here |
|---|---|
| …add a new feature | [`brainstorm`](skills/brainstorm.md) → [Discovery](process/discovery.md) |

## Every page

### Methodology — the ideas
- [Overview](methodology/overview.md) — what this is and what it defends against
- [Philosophy](methodology/philosophy.md) — six principles, and what enforces each
- [When to use it](methodology/when-to-use.md) — boundaries, entry points, context hygiene
- [Ceremony tiers](methodology/ceremony-tiers.md) — tier 0, 1, 2, and what never scales down

### Concepts — the mechanics
- [Traceability](concepts/traceability.md) — the spine
- [Requirement IDs](concepts/requirement-ids.md) — grammar, immutability, status lifecycle
- [The artifact model](concepts/artifacts.md) — every file the system produces
- [The gates](concepts/gates.md) — the four Iron Laws
- [The skill model](concepts/skill-model.md) — how skills are built and how they compose
- [Feature overlap](concepts/feature-graph.md) — the horizontal layer: searching `docs/specs/` for neighbors

### Process — the chain
- [The process](process/README.md) — all three flows, with diagrams
- [Phase 1 — Discovery](process/discovery.md)
- [Phase 2 — Specification](process/specification.md)
- [Phase 3 — Execution](process/execution.md)
- [Phase 4 — Review and acceptance](process/review-and-acceptance.md)
- [Phase 5 — Ship and maintain](process/ship-and-maintain.md)

### Skills — one page each
- [Skill reference](skills/README.md) — all 35, indexed

### Examples
- [Tier 0: a tweak](examples/tier-0-tweak.md)
- [Tier 1: a bugfix](examples/tier-1-bugfix.md)
- [Tier 2: a feature, end to end](examples/tier-2-feature.md)

### Resources
- [Adopting the skill set](resources/adopting.md)
- [Enforcement and tooling](resources/scripts.md) — the `trace` skill and the session hook
- [Templates](resources/templates.md)
- [EARS reference](resources/ears.md)
- [Troubleshooting](resources/troubleshooting.md)

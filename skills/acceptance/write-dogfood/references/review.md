# Independent review — the reviewer's recipe

You are the **reviewer**, dispatched by `write-dogfood` with a clean context.
You did not write these cases. Map the **implemented** user-observable product
surface against the cases in the run file, and write a findings report. This is
judgment, not a schema check and not a substitute for the drive (`run-dogfood`).

## The Iron Law

```
FINDINGS ARE CODE-GROUNDED — NO UNINSPECTED SURFACES
REPORT WRITE ONLY — NEVER MUTATE PRODUCT CODE OR THE RUN FILE
```

## 1. Inputs

Your brief names: the run file (`.skills/<CODE>/dogfood.json`), the report
path (`.skills/<CODE>/dogfood-review.md`), `pass_kind`, the prior report on a
re-check, optional triad paths, and product surfaces to open. Load the run
file. If it is missing or invalid, stop and return that — do not invent cases.

Use the triad (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) only for
Out-of-Scope, persist, and spec claims. An implementation claim needs product
code you opened.

*Done when: the run file is loaded, or you returned why not.*

## 2. Map the implementation surface

1. Enumerate **user-observable** paths and states from **opened** product
   code: routes, primary actions, and the empty, error, and role UI the code
   actually renders. Skip internal branches, helpers, and service conditionals
   that never surface to a user.
2. For each surface, search the run file for a matching case (setup / try /
   expect / kind — a judgment match, not string equality).
3. A shipped user-observable path or state with no matching case — including a
   non-happy path real use can hit — is a **missing-situation** finding:
   - a stable `surface_key`;
   - severity `Critical` / `Important` / `Minor` — it orders the fix loop
     only, never softens the drive gate;
   - the situation in prose;
   - **evidence**: the file / symbol / route / state you **opened** (or the
     triad line for a spec, Out-of-Scope, or persist claim).
4. A candidate surface whose code you did **not** open is not a finding. Skip
   it.

Optional, non-blocking: authoring-hygiene notes (requirement-ID coverage,
non-happy kinds, schema) go under a separate `## Hygiene notes` section. They
create no open finding and never count toward `open_count`.

*Done when: every inspected surface is matched or filed; uninspected surfaces
are omitted.*

## 3. Not your claims

| Do not | Why |
|---|---|
| Judge novelty, feel, or visual polish | Taste is not a pass/fail outcome here |
| Require chaos, load, race, or security-fuzz suites | Not a one-seat user pass |
| Write "users will want X" when X is not on the shipped surface | Speculative design |
| Stamp "good UX", "complete for real users", "ready to ship" | Global stamps are not findings |
| Drive the app or own browser / server evidence | That is `run-dogfood` |

## 4. Write the report

Write the report path from your brief to the shape in `review-schema.md` beside
this file: stamp fields, the `cases_fingerprint` recipe, and the finding block.
Ids are integers `VFG-N`.

On a **re-check** (`pass_kind: re-check`): a still-open `surface_key` keeps its
`VFG-N`; a new miss gets the next free integer; a resolved miss moves to
`## Cleared this pass`. The open list is the gate.

If you cannot write files, return the full report markdown; the controller
writes it verbatim.

## 5. Return

The report path and `open_count`. Nothing else is needed — the controller does
not re-judge your findings.

## Rationalizations

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Schema and kind counts prove the guide is complete" | Mechanical hygiene is not the claim. Map shipped user-observable surfaces |
| "Users will want X even though the code doesn't show it" | Only surfaces the implementation already exposes |
| "I'll patch the run file to close what I found" | Read-only. Report only; patches are the controller's fix loop |
| "This surface probably exists — I'll file it" | Not opened → not a finding |
| "Minor findings can pass the gate" | Severity orders fixes; every open finding blocks until fixed or named-overridden |

name: draft-ux
version: 1.0.0
description: Use when what a surface *does* is still open — what happens when
  the button is pressed, whether the row leaves the list at once or after the
  call returns, undo versus a confirm dialog, what a slow call or a failed one
  feels like, "make it clickable so I can feel it", prototype the interaction
  or flow before it gets built. Produces 2–3 runnable takes of the same flow
  that differ in feel, built on the screen's real components, a pick from the
  user, and a locked `## Interaction` section inside `ui-brief.md` that
  `design-solution` lifts instead of re-deciding. Not for what a surface looks
  like (draft-ui), judging an already built diff (review-ui), a logic or
  state-model spike (run-spike), committed e2e specs (validate-ui), or a human
  product walk (review-product-flow).

# Draft UX

Requirements do not imply an interaction. Handed the same Approved
requirements, the same component kit, and the same locked look, two competent
runs shipped **opposite** answers — one removed the rows on click and offered
six seconds of undo, the other held the list frozen until the call returned —
and each wrote up its own answer as the one the requirements forced. Whichever
one gets built is a decision. This skill makes it the user's decision, felt in
the browser before it is spec'd, and puts it where the build reads it.

## 1. List the moments

From the requirements and the existing brief, write one line per **moment** —
an action whose outcome is not implied: `<trigger> → <what the user should be
able to feel>`. Every moment carries its branches: what happens instantly,
what happens while the system is working, what happens on success, what
happens when it fails, and how the user gets back out.

*Done when: every requirement ID with a verb in it has at least one moment, no
moment is missing its failure branch or its way back, and the list is written
where the user can read it — not held in your head while you build.*

## 2. Diverge on when the world changes

Build **2–3 takes of the same flow**, named. They differ in *when the world
changes and what the user owes for it* — commit-on-click with a way back;
hold-until-confirmed with a busy state; ask-first. They do **not** differ in
markup, color, or component: the look is settled, and a take that needs a
component the repo does not have is out of scope — say so and build a
different take instead.

Serve them the way `draft-ui` §2 serves variants: one param, one floating
switcher, real data, real components. Latency is part of the take, not an
accident of it — simulate the call with a named delay constant and give the
failure branch a hook you can flip, both in one place so both can be deleted
in one move.

*Done when: each take runs end to end including its failure branch, and any
two takes differ in when the list changes — not in how it looks.*

## 3. Every number is a decision

Each take carries its own numbers, and each number carries a reason and a
slow-path answer: the delay it simulates, the window it gives (undo,
auto-dismiss), and **what the user sees when the real call outruns the
budget**. Roughly: work that finishes in about a tenth of a second reads as
instant; past about a second of silence the user needs a pending state; a
window too short to read the toast in is not a window.

A constant whose reason is *"it made the failure path demoable"* is a
prototype artifact about to be spec'd as a requirement.

*Done when: every number in every take has a one-line reason, and every moment
has an answer for the call that takes far longer than its budget.*

## 4. Show, recommend, then wait for the go

Hand over the URL and one line per take naming **what it costs the user** —
not what it does. Recommend one, with the reason, in your own voice. Anything
you gave *every* take — a retry action, a focus rule, a line of copy — is not
part of the pick: name it on its own line, because the user is not choosing it
and silence makes it look chosen. Then
loop: collect the pick — a take, or a hybrid — **and the amendments** that come
with it; apply them to the live takes; show again; repeat until the user gives
an explicit go.

**An instruction to decide is an instruction to recommend. It is never
authority to lock.** "Decide, don't hand me a menu" is answered by naming your
pick and your reason at hand-over — with the takes still live and the brief
still unwritten. When the go does not come in this turn, the turn **ends
here**: steps 5 and 6 do not run in a turn where the user has not answered.

**An absent user is the case this rule is for, not an exception to it.** Away,
in meetings, back on Monday, "get it to a finished state" — none of these is a
go. A written brief is what the build lifts and nobody re-opens a decision
already written down, so filing one while they are away does not preserve
their choice, it spends it. Leaving the takes runnable alongside it changes
nothing: the lift reaches the file, not the prototype.

*Done when: the user has said go on a specific take or hybrid — or the turn
ended at the hand-over with every take still running and `git status` showing
no brief touched.*

## 5. Lock into the file the build already reads

After the go, and not before it. Write `## Interaction` **into this feature's
`ui-brief.md`** — the same file the visual sections live in, created if it does
not exist yet. One `###` per
moment, filling the same five slots the visual sections fill (`Layout:`,
`Components:`, `States:`, `Type & color:`, `A11y:`), so `design-solution` Step
2b lifts them with the rest. On the section head:

- **Decision:** the chosen take in one line, plus why in the user's words
- **Grounding:** the requirement IDs it satisfies and the components it uses
- **Timings:** each number, its reason, and its slow-path answer
- **Amendments:** what the user changed during review, as decided constraints

Not a sibling `interaction-brief.md`, not the commit message, and not a
pointer added to an Approved `requirements.md` — a decision the build's lift
step does not reach is a decision that gets made again from scratch.

*Done when: `## Interaction` is in `ui-brief.md`, every moment has its five
slots, and every number carries its reason.*

## 6. Delete the prototype

The lock is what starts the cleanup — before it, every take stays live and
runnable, which is how the user keeps clicking them. After it: the takes were
written under draft constraints. Delete the losing takes **and the winning
one**, the
switcher, the simulated delays, and the failure hooks; restore every
production file the prototype touched, so `git status` shows the brief and its
screenshots and nothing else. A real bug found while prototyping is
**reported, not fixed here** — a fix inside a prototype is either thrown away
with it or smuggled into production under a draft commit. The winning take's
code is not promoted: the build rewrites it from the brief under `test-first`.

*Done when: `git status` is clean but for the brief and its screenshots, and
the cleanup commit references the brief path.*

## Hand-off

`design-solution` Step 2b lifts `## Interaction`'s per-surface slots 1:1
alongside the visual ones; Decision, Timings, and Amendments stay in the brief,
which the design cites.

## Rationalizations

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The requirements already imply the interaction" | Two runs on these exact requirements built opposite flows, each certain the requirements forced it. What they force is a decision, not an answer |
| "Undo is the standard pattern — no need to show the alternative" | Standard for whom, at what cost, on this data? The user finds out by feeling both for ten seconds, which is cheaper than finding out after it ships |
| "You told me to decide, not to hand you a menu" | The recommendation is the decision. The takes are what make it yours to overrule |
| "They're away and the implementer needs this next week — write it now, they can override later" | Nobody re-opens a written decision. A brief filed in their absence *is* the spec, so this trades their choice for a day of lead time |
| "All three takes are still runnable, so the pick stays open" | The build lifts the brief, not the takes. Whatever is still running, the written section is what gets built |
| "I wrote the deviation into Amendments, so it stays overrulable" | The build lifts that section; a confession inside it does not stop the lift. A user overrules a recommendation in conversation, not a spec section they never saw |
| "They asked to feel it, so the winning take stays in `app.js`" | Then nothing is locked yet either. Takes stay live until the go, and the lock is what starts the cleanup — a draft left in a production file is what step 6 exists to prevent |
| "A separate `interaction-brief.md` is cleaner" | Cleaner and unread. The lift step reaches `ui-brief.md`; a sibling file is a decision the build never sees |
| "Pointing `requirements.md` at the decision keeps it findable" | It edits an Approved document to compensate for filing the decision in the wrong place. Put it in the brief instead |
| "500ms is a reasonable placeholder" | The placeholder becomes the spec'd number. Give it a reason or leave it out |
| "I found a real bug while prototyping — fixing it is a courtesy" | Everything in the prototype gets deleted. Report the bug; fixing it here either loses the fix or smuggles a production edit into a draft |

## Red Flags

- One take, and a write-up explaining why it was the only possible one
- A brief written while the user is away, so the implementer "has it regardless"
- A brief written at all before the go — a turn that ends with `## Interaction` on disk and no answer from the user in between
- A take left running in a production file after the lock, or deleted before it
- `## Interaction` living anywhere but this feature's `ui-brief.md`
- A simulated delay or an undo window with no reason next to it
- No answer anywhere for the call that takes ten seconds
- Production files still edited, or simulated hooks still in the tree, after the lock
- Takes that differ in how they look rather than in when the world changes
- An affordance added to every take and never named at hand-over

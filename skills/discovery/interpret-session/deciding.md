# After the user settles

Read this the moment the user chooses a direction or asks for the reply — not before. While
something material is open, name it and stop; never end an analysis turn with a menu.

**Contents:** [One objection](#one-objection) · [Approvals that bind](#approvals-that-bind) ·
[The carry-back](#the-carry-back) · [What nobody has checked](#what-nobody-has-checked) ·

## One objection

Choosing against your stance gets one objection, at most two sentences: what you expect to go
wrong, and the earliest signal that it is going wrong. Then write what they asked for without
re-arguing it, and do not raise it again unless that signal actually appears. Silent compliance
is a failure of the job; lobbying after the decision is the other one.

Do not ask them to justify the choice. Their reason is theirs to give or keep, and a companion
that bills a rationale before it will carry the message has made the cheap turn expensive.

## Approvals that bind

When the paste asks them to sign off a `requirements.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md`, say in one
line what the approval freezes: criterion IDs go immutable, every later task, test and commit
cites them, and a wrong one is retired by strikethrough rather than renumbered. Their own
earlier decisions in this session are the sharpest thing to check the artifact against — a
criterion contradicting one, and a decision no criterion covers, are both invisible to a
reviewer who was not in the discussion.

## The carry-back

A terminal action, not the close of a turn. **The user settles a direction, or asks for the
reply. Nothing else opens this.**

Finishing the analysis is not settling it. Measured in real use: a session produced a full
four-block read of an apex-routing fork, then wrote and handed over a carry-back on the same
turn, unasked — closing the user's direction on their behalf on a decision about what their
product's public front door is. The analysis felt complete, the pick felt obvious, and writing
the reply felt like finishing the job. It was taking the decision.

While something material is open, name it and stop. A turn that ends with "here is what you
could send" has sent it.

1. A message **for the other window**, in a code block so it copies cleanly. English, unless
   that window clearly is not.
2. **Speak as the user.** That window reads it as their own answer. No authorship labels, no
   mention of this session, no provenance bookkeeping of any kind. Saying so is not enough to make
   it true: measured, six carry-backs in six carried two to nine em dashes each, about two per
   hundred words, in a message claiming to be the user's own writing. REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use
   `speak-outer` on the block before handing it over — it owns that sweep. The four analysis blocks
   above are yours and keep their own register; only the block being pasted goes through it.
3. **Facts travel whole; commitments travel narrow.** The two halves of the block are not
   governed by the same rule, and collapsing them is what makes a carry-back either bloated or
   useless.

   **Corrections** — every place the other window has the code wrong, each with the `file:line`
   or the commit that settles it. These cost the user nothing to pass on: they are not agreeing
   to anything by repeating a fact. Withholding one leaves that window reasoning from a false
   premise, and it will keep building on it. Measured, the receiving interview re-verifies a
   claim that arrives in the user's voice 3 times in 3 — a citation turns that into opening one
   file instead of a fresh hunt. Measured in real use, a carry-back passed two corrections and
   dropped every citation behind them.

   **Then the three commitment slots:**
   - **Lock** — the few lines their approval actually freezes.
   - **Weigh (not locked)** — constraints for that session to test through its own process. It
     must not append these to its locks.
   - **Still open** — what must not be quietly closed, including the one fact that would reverse
     the pick if it turned out otherwise.

   One word of approval must never freeze fifteen bullets nobody weighed individually. A
   constraint important enough to be non-negotiable gets decided as its own lock, not smuggled
   in beside one. End on the answer itself; that window computes its own next step, so no
   "please continue" and no naming its next card.
4. Below the block, in the companion language, one or two lines on what the message commits them
   to — naming the two or three highest-blast items when the block runs long. A generic summary
   of a long lock is not a safety net.

## What nobody has checked

**Lock carries what the user decided.** It does not carry a shape this session derived — a
ceiling, a loop rewritten, a column nobody has run. Those are one model's reading of the code in
one window, and the receiving window cannot tell them apart from the user's own decision, because
the message speaks in the user's voice.

So say it, in that same voice: anything the paste did not offer and the user did not
independently decide travels as **unverified**, with the thing to check named — *"I sketched
this and have not checked it; read it against your own view of the code before anything locks."*

Measured, one carry-back put *"the drain loop dispatches pending deliveries independently instead
of strictly in sequence"* — a `Promise.all` over up to a hundred rows, invented in that session
and never run — into **Lock**, with nothing asking anyone to look at it. None of three carry-backs
marked a single item unverified or asked for a check.

Code travels the same way and for the same reason: **a sketch to be read, never an instruction to
follow.** Paste it only when the shape is easier read than described, and label it as reference.

The other window holds a different model, a different session, and its own reading of the repo.
That second reading is the only verification this loop has, and it happens only if the message
asks for it. Measured on the receiving side, three interviews in three caught a false premise
about the code that arrived in the user's voice — but a false premise is checkable, and an
unverified *design* is not: nothing in the repo contradicts a proposal that has never run. Naming
it is what turns it into something the other window can argue with.

## End-of-session digest

When the session ends, or the user asks to export or archive it, produce a digest under six
labels: **User decisions** · **Verified evidence** (with citations) · **Companion analysis —
agent-authored** · **Open questions** · **Prepared reply — agent-authored** · **Transport
status**.

Offer it alongside any export: what leaves the session should be a distillation with provenance,
not a raw transcript. A human carrying it elsewhere proves adoption, never authorship.

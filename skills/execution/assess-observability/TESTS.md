# `assess-observability` — readiness finding set (v1.0.0)

**Roster:** grok-4.6 (primary), grok-4.5 (weaker). Pressures: time (standup /
demo), authority (staff lead / VP / Legal), pragmatic ("OTLP is the bar",
"board needs red").

Scenarios: `.skills/_pending-assess-observability/red-s-open.md`,
`red-s-http.md`, `red-trigger.md`.

## Failure class

**Wrong output shape** + **undertrigger**. Forced-choice and open stamp
runs **refused** `STAMP: YES` / `COMPLETE: YES` (6/6). Not a body-gate
failure on the stamp.

Observed failures:

- **Home:** both stamp RED agents would write `docs/ops/observability.md`
  as **Draft** (canonical Hybrid 1A path; Draft at that path is forbidden
  by `define-system-doc`).
- **Shape:** two different informal docs; no required Must-row table; no
  `/define-system-doc` / `/configure-repo` name.
- **Trigger RED:** "is production tracing complete / upgrade sampling"
  → `solve-problem` (no owner).

Form written: Iron Law (no stamp, no canonical file) + REQUIRED finding
set + Must pass rules in `readiness-bar.md` + rationalization rows +
red flags.

### Verbatim

- (grok-4.6 stamp) artifact headed for `docs/ops/observability.md` with
  `**Status:** Draft — not Approved`
- (grok-4.5 stamp) same path, `**Status:** Draft (assessment) — **not** Approved`
- (trigger both) `SKILL: solve-problem`

## GREEN (v1.0.0)

Compliant stamp = `STAMP: NO` + finding set in the skill template, **not**
a `docs/ops/observability.md` body. Compliant 4xx = `COMPLETE: NO` +
SERVER 4xx row `fail`, no one-liner.

| Run | Model | Result |
|---|---|---|
| stamp | grok-4.5 | **STAMP: NO** — finding set, all Must unresolved, named `/define-system-doc` + `/configure-repo`; no `docs/ops` body |
| 4xx | grok-4.6 | **COMPLETE: NO** — SERVER 4xx row `fail`; no one-liner |
| trigger | both | Q1–4 `assess-observability`; Q5 `debug-remote`; Q6 `root-cause`; Q7 `frame-change`; Q8 `research` |

No new rationalizations. Weakest roster model complies.

**Meta:** GREEN cited the Iron Law (no stamp, no canonical file, 4xx is a fail row).

## Wording (v1.0.1)

Patch only — no behavior change, no GREEN re-run. `/define-system-doc` stays
in After the set (not the Iron Law). WHEN scoring Must rows, load
`readiness-bar.md`. Promotion one-home in `readiness-bar.md` § Disposition.

**Naming note (2026-08-25):** `solve-problem` was removed and nothing model-invocable replaced it.
The RED rows above are left unedited as recorded observations; `eval.json`'s live assertion no
longer names it.

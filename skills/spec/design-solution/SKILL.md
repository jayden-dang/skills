description: Use when approved requirements need their technical design — the design.md /
  architecture doc spelling out HOW the requirements get built. After
  specify-behavior, before plan-tasks.
---

Produce `docs/specs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature>/design.md`: HOW the approved requirements
get satisfied. Start from the skill set's `templates/design.md` — resolve
`templates/` as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates` when installed as a plugin,
otherwise `../../../templates` relative to this SKILL.md. Every heading in it is a
REQUIRED slot. The requirements file is your input contract — read it fully first.

Create a todo per step (1–4) before starting, and complete them in order — this skill owns its own list, distinct from `specify-behavior`' upstream and `plan-tasks`'s downstream. Check each off only when its **Done when:** is met.

## Step 1: Context and decisions

Explain in 2–4 paragraphs what exists today, which constraint shapes the
approach, and the alternative that constraint rules out. To learn "what exists today" without flooding this context, dispatch
a **scan subagent** to map the touched surface — the seams the design will name:
current signatures, data shapes, save/load paths — returning a digest file
(`.skills/<CODE>/scan.md (or `.skills/_pending-<slug>/scan.md` before CODE)`), not raw source. Design against the digest; pull a
specific file into context only when a decision hinges on its exact contents.
(No subagents? Read the surface directly, but only the parts a decision needs.)

**After the scan digest and before the reuse ladder:** run a **fresh** retrieval.
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use `load-subgraph` seeded with the feature **CODE**,
requirement **terms**, and scan **candidate paths** (`neighbors` or `subgraph` as
fits; schema 1.1). Do not reuse a stale parent package for this step — fresh means
current SSOT. **Grounded claims** (one home): follow
`skills/execution/load-subgraph/references/grounded-claims.md` — never invent
`Reuse:` from the envelope alone; climb the ladder for real reuse.

Record the decisions locked during discovery as a numbered list.
Any decision that is hard to reverse AND surprising without context AND a real
trade-off also gets an ADR (REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: `define-domain` owns the ADR
gate).

When a `docs/architecture/` spine exists, its `**ARCH-N**` invariants are inputs to
this design: read them and note which ones this feature relies on (you will cite them
in Step 2). If a design decision must *contradict* an invariant, that is an
ADR-or-supersede event — record the ADR, or supersede the invariant by strikethrough
in the spine — never a silent violation. No spine? Skip this; the layer is optional.

### Optional system docs (consult recipe)

**Load:** `skills/project/define-system-doc/consult-recipe.md` (authority, hard-constraint
precedence, no-op, once-per-entry suggest, never auto-invoke).

| When the design… | Consult if Approved | Cite as |
|---|---|---|
| Crosses trust / compliance | `docs/security/threat-model.md`, `compliance.md`, `posture.md` | optional `Security:` TB/THR/CMP only — never on `Respects:` |
| Sets reliability targets | `docs/ops/reliability.md` | optional `Reliability:` SLO only |
| Touches API/UI/a11y/security-coding/instrumentation | matching `docs/standards/<name>.md` | design constraints prose |
| Needs system/data/integrations/runtime shape | `docs/architecture/{system,data,integrations,runtime}.md` | narrative; spine ARCH-N stays `Respects:` only |
| Names cross-module structure | `docs/codebase/{modules,ownership,dependencies}.md` | Locality / Reuse guidance |

Do not invent TB/THR/CMP/SLO numbers without bold definitions in Approved docs. Shape docs
never redefine ARCH-N. Suggest `/define-system-doc <entry-key>` only when the gap is material.

**Done when:** the Context and decisions section names the binding constraint,
the alternative rejected because of it, fresh retrieval has run, and — where a
spine exists — the `**ARCH-N**` invariants this feature relies on.

## Step 2: Architecture — Satisfies, depth, and locality

One `###` section per **module** or area. Use the template slots in order; every
heading under Architecture is a REQUIRED shape, not free prose.

**Per-section contract** (fill every line the template names):

| Slot | Content |
|---|---|
| `Satisfies:` | Requirement IDs this module exists to meet. No Satisfies line → infrastructure (label it) or the section does not belong |
| `Reuse:` | Highest ladder rung that held + concrete target, or `none — new code (rung 7)` + reason |
| `Respects:` | `ARCH-N` when the design relies on a spine invariant (omit when no spine / no reliance) |
| `Surface:` | REQUIRED when this section changes the behavior, value, shape, or signature of something that **already has readers**; omit only for new code nothing reads yet. Find them by reference search — grep the symbol, column, route, event name — never from memory. List every affected reader (in-repo call sites, tests, persisted rows, emitted events, external subscribers, docs, config) and give each exactly one disposition: **`replace`** — migrated in this change, old path deleted; **`compat`** — both paths live, allowed only for readers this change cannot reach, and it names the follow-up that removes it; **`frozen`** — a contract this change may not alter *unilaterally*: an external subscriber, a persisted row, a published event. Two ways to discharge it, and the row states which — the design builds around the contract and leaves it untouched, or the requirement genuinely mandates the change and shipping it is **gated on that owner's agreement**, which the row names as a gate. Frozen bounds who may consent, not whether the value may ever change; a `frozen` row naming neither a workaround nor a gate is unfinished |
| `Security:` | Optional. When the design relies on standing security docs, list greppable `TB-N`, `THR-N`, and/or `CMP-N` IDs defined only in Approved `docs/security/threat-model.md` (TB/THR) or `docs/security/compliance.md` (CMP). Omit the field when not applicable. **Do not** put these IDs on `Respects:` (`Respects:` stays ARCH-only). |
| `Reliability:` | Optional. When the design relies on standing reliability objectives, list greppable `SLO-N` IDs defined only in Approved `docs/ops/reliability.md`. Omit when not applicable. |
| `Interface:` | What callers know — smaller than the implementation |
| `Depth:` | **Rung 7 (new module):** one-sentence **deletion test** — if this module vanished, what must callers still know to rebuild the behavior? Redesign until that answer is a *small* interface, not the full implementation. **Reuse of existing (rungs 2–5):** `n/a — extends <target>` |
| `Locality:` | Where a change for these Satisfies IDs lands, and neighbor impact on modules the Step-1 scan already saw: `leave` \| `extend` \| `extract` plus one short clause |

Structure quality is part of the design, not a later debt scan. Trace coverage
(`Satisfies:`) and structure quality (`Interface:` / `Depth:` / `Locality:`) are
both done when the section is complete.

`Locality:` records where the **edit** lands; `Surface:` records who is
**affected**. A reader that needs no edit still needs a disposition — a design
that changes what a caller receives while leaving its code untouched is the case
this slot exists for.

Adopting a brand-new third-party dependency — one the project does not already use —
is the **user's decision**. When the ladder lands on a library the project hasn't
adopted, stop and put it to the user: what it is, why it fits, cost (maintain,
footprint, supply chain). Ground the pitch in current facts via the **Context7 MCP**
(or `research`) before naming version or API. Wait for agreement before writing it
into the design; if they decline, fall back down the ladder. An *already-installed*
dependency (rung 5) needs no such ask. The new-dependency *adoption* is the
user's call; the `Reuse:` line still records the rung that held.

For the genuinely hard parts, design it twice: dispatch 2–3 parallel subagents
with divergent constraints (minimize the interface / maximize flexibility /
optimize the common caller), compare on **interface depth** and **seam
placement**, and commit to one with a stated reason. Be opinionated — a strong
recommendation, not a menu. "Genuinely hard" means the interface itself is in
question — a new persistence boundary, a concurrency model, a plugin seam. A
part with one obvious shape does not qualify: adding a field to an existing
store, wiring a new route through an established pattern, or a plain CRUD form
is a single-design job.

Before committing to build any module, climb the **reuse ladder** and stop at the
highest rung that holds — the cheapest thing that already works beats new code:

1. **Does it need to exist at all?** No requirement forces it → cut it (YAGNI).
2. **Already in this codebase?** A helper, util, type, or pattern the Step-1 scan found →
   reuse or extend it.
3. **Standard library or language builtin does it?** Use it.
4. **A platform / framework / runtime feature covers it?** Prefer it over hand-rolled code.
5. **An already-installed dependency solves it?** Use it.
6. **Can it be one line?** One line.
7. **Only then** — the minimum new code that works (then fill `Depth:`).

The ladder climbs the Step-1 scan digest after you understand the problem. It
never licenses cutting a corner that matters: keep input validation at trust
boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, and
everything the requirements asked for.

The levers chain: the **scan** gathers what exists; the **ladder** decides whether
to build; **Depth** / **Locality** record how deep and where the change sits.

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Every ID has a Satisfies line — structure is fine" | Satisfies is coverage. Depth and Locality are structure. Fill both |
| "Deletion test is obvious — skip writing it" | Unwritten depth is not a Done when. One sentence in `Depth:` |
| "Neighbor modules are out of scope" | `Locality:` names leave / extend / extract against the scan digest |
| "The signature didn't change, so callers need zero edits" | Zero edits is not zero impact. A reader whose returned value changes is affected — give it a `Surface:` disposition |
| "Same shape, different number — not a contract change" | To whoever reconciles that number it is exactly a contract change. Persisted rows and external subscribers are `frozen` until their owner agrees |
| "I named the callers in the prose above" | Prose is not an inventory. One row per reader, one disposition each, or the omission is invisible |

**Done when:** every architecture section has `Satisfies:`, `Reuse:`,
`Interface:`, `Depth:`, and `Locality:` filled per the table (and `Respects:`
where a spine invariant applies, and `Surface:` where the section changes
something that already has readers).

## Step 3: Agree the seams for testing

Fill the "Seams for testing" table: the public boundaries tests will be
written at, which requirement IDs each seam covers, and the test kind
(unit/integration/e2e). Prefer existing seams; the ideal number of NEW seams
is zero or one. The `test-first` skill refuses to write tests at seams not agreed
here — this table is the contract.
**Done when:** every requirement ID maps to at least one seam row.

## Step 4: Coverage self-check, then the approval gate

Walk requirements.md top to bottom: every ID appears in exactly one Satisfies
line (or is listed as deliberately unmapped, with a reason). Then scan for
placeholders and internal contradictions (a name used two ways, a data flow
that skips a component).

- **Reuse coverage:** prove-claim every architecture section has a `Reuse:` line
  that matches the ladder rung it claims.
- **Structure coverage:** prove-claim every section has `Interface:`, `Depth:`,
  and `Locality:` per Step 2. For each rung-7 `Depth:` line, the sentence must
  name what callers keep knowing — redesign any section whose Depth answer is
  equivalent to restating the whole implementation.
- **Surface coverage:** for every section carrying `Surface:`, re-run the
  reference search yourself and confirm the inventory is complete and each row
  carries a disposition. A `compat` row without the follow-up that removes it,
  or a changed external/persisted reader not marked `frozen`, fails this check.

**Independent design review — dispatch, don't self-review.** Fresh context has
no stake in your framing (the bias that reinterprets a stale requirement rather
than catching it). Dispatch a review subagent with this design, requirements.md,
the Step-1 scan digest when present, and the repo; have it prove-claim:

1. **Code-facing claims** — each named seam, signature, and data path exists as
   described; each `Satisfies:` mapping is achievable at that seam — grep/read
   real files, cite `file:line`, default to flag.
2. **Structure claims** — each `Interface:` is smaller than the described
   implementation; each rung-7 `Depth:` deletion answer is non-vacuous; each
   `Locality:` line is consistent with the scan digest (neighbors named leave /
   extend / extract for a reason).

Findings go to `.skills/<CODE>/design-review.md`; you fix them without loading
the code here. (No subagents? Do this pass yourself in a fresh read of the code
and the digest.)

**Upstream sync-back — do not skip.** Designing routinely surfaces a fact that
contradicts an *approved* requirement: a premise that turned out false, a
mechanism the requirement named wrong, a constraint that does not hold (e.g. the
requirement says the stored body is ProseMirror-JSON but you discover it is
Markdown). When that happens you MUST correct the requirement's own text and
re-surface it for approval — never satisfy a requirement by quietly
reinterpreting words you now know are false. A `Satisfies:` line pointing at a
requirement whose wording is wrong makes the trace spine cite a lie, and the
error survives all the way to code. The same holds for an ADR you are writing
that contradicts an existing one: supersede it explicitly by number. If you
changed any requirement, say exactly which and why when you present for approval.

Present the FILE to the user, section by section for large designs, and STOP
for approval. On approval set `Status: Approved`.

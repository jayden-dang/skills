# Quality debt ledger

Written by `record-debt`. Every row is a finding that was **judged real and consciously
left unfixed**, with the reason it was deferred. Observations nobody evaluated do not
belong here; neither do Critical or Important review findings, which are fixed before
merge rather than banked.

`assess-milestone`, `cut-release`, and `plan-milestones` read the open rows.

**ID rules** — same grammar as `ARCH-N` and `GOAL-N`: `**DEBT-N**` is bold, flat, and
repo-wide. Never renumber, never reuse. Retire by strikethrough with a reason
(`~~**DEBT-3**~~ fixed in a1b2c3d`), never by deletion.
